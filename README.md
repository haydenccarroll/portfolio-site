# My Portfolio Site

### TODO

* break down some elements in home.scss
* rethink $hacker-green color
* change header design
* add images to some projects
* add more animation/responsive stuff
    - on contact me form, have the text insertion cursor look like a terminal one
    - make stuff fade/change color when scrolling past (sorta similar to header)
