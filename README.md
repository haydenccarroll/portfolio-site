# My Portfolio Site

### TODO

* break down some elements into other components in home.js (its kinda cluttered)
* add all images + outside links
* work on resizing the pdf so it looks natural
* add more animation/responsive stuff
    - on contact me form, have the text insertion cursor look like a terminal one
    - make stuff fade/change color when scrolling past (sorta similar to header)
